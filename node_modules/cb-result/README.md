[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/cb-result.png?mini=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/cb-result/)

* [What is it?](#what-is-it)

### What is it

Node.js has the async programming model. Most of the function calls have the last parameter as a callback parameter, which is a function reference.
Usually you have to deal with each callback's error/success state, this duplicates code a lot.
